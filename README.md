#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Santiago de Compostela (USC). Additionally, I am continuing to develop my undergraduate thesis in Computer Engineering, focused on the classification of multispectral images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

### Trajectory :briefcase:
 - :books: I'm studying a master degree in Artificial Intelligence at [USC](https://www.usc.gal/en/studies/masters/engineering-and-architecture/masters-degree-artificial-intelligence).
 - :man_student: I studied Maths and Computer Engineering at [USC](https://www.usc.gal/en/studies/degrees/engineering-and-architecture/double-degree-informatics-engineering-and-mathematics).
 - :abacus: During last months of 2023, I worked as a research assistant at [CITMAga](https://citmaga.gal/en/home) in statistical classification.
 - :computer: During the summer of 2023, I worked at [Gradiant](https://github.com/Gradiant) as an intern on NLP tasks.
 - :rocket: I received a scholarship to collaborate research in NLP during the summer of 2022 at [CiTIUS](https://citius.gal).

### Projects :film_projector:
 - :hammer: I'm currently working on developing a [conditional version of StyleGAN2](https://github.com/antongomez/Conditional-StyleGAN2) that works with multispectral images.
 - :turtle: As a continuation of my work at CITMAga, I collaborated to develop multiclass functionality for the open-source project [caretEnsemble](https://github.com/zachmayer/caretEnsemble).

### Interests & Skills :mag_right:

 - :speech_balloon: I'm experienced in Java, C, Python, R and C++.
 - :baby: I'm also learning Julia.
 - :dart: My main interests are NLP, Computer Vision, Statistical Classification & Remote Sensing.
 - :zap: I enjoy participating in programming competitions and taking on new challenges.
 - :family: I'm looking to collaborate on Open Source projects.

### Programming Competitions :video_game:
 - :trophy: In July 2024, our team, _AbuelosDG_, finished in the [11th position](https://ada-byron.es/2024/nac/resultado.php) in the national phase of AdaByron, improving by 2 positions compared to the previous edition and solving 3 more problems than last year.
 - :computer: In May 2024, our team, participated in [HackUPC](https://hackupc.com/), where we developed [OpenSplit](https://opensplit.co/), a bot designed to help groups of people manage joint expenses and minimize the number of transfers when balancing accounts ([Project](https://devpost.com/software/opensplitbot) on Devpost - links to [backend](https://github.com/CastilloDel/OpenSplitBackend), [frontend](https://github.com/DaniPVargas/OpenSplitFrontend) and [telegram bot](https://github.com/DaniPVargas/OpenSplitBot) on GitHub).
