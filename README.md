#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a final year Mathematics and Computer Engineering student. In addition to the training received during my degree, I received a scholarship to start research in the field of NLP in the summer of 2022.

Currently, I'm working on my Mathematics thesis, where I'm studying statistical classifier ensembles with the aim of developing a system to evaluate ensembles. Additionally, I'm exploring the idea of using classifiers to augment the features of a population to increase knowledge about it and to be able to apply another statistical classifier on the augmented population.

### Trajectory
 - :books: I'm studying Maths and Computer Engineering at USC.
 - :trophy: Our team, CostaCompas, won one of the prizes os HackUDC. You can view our project here.
 - :rocket: I received a scholarship to reasearch in NLP in 2022.

### Interests & Skills

 - :speech_balloon: I'm experienced in Java, C, and Python
 - :baby: I'm also learning C++.
 - ðŸ“¶ My main interests are NLP, Clustering & Multivariate Analysis
 - :checkered_flag: I enjoy participating in programming competitions and taking on new challenges
 - :family: I'm looking to collaborate on Open Source projects.
