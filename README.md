#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Santiago de Compostela (USC). Additionally, I am continuing to develop my undergraduate thesis in Computer Engineering, focused on the classification of multispectral images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

### Trajectory :briefcase:
 - :mag: I'm currently working at CiTIUS with a research scholarship, continuing my bachelor's thesis by exploring the use of GANs for classifying multispectral images.
 - :books: I'm studying a master degree in Artificial Intelligence at [USC](https://www.usc.gal/en/studies/masters/engineering-and-architecture/masters-degree-artificial-intelligence).
 - :man_student: I studied Maths and Computer Engineering at [USC](https://www.usc.gal/en/studies/degrees/engineering-and-architecture/double-degree-informatics-engineering-and-mathematics).
 - :abacus: During last months of 2023, I worked as a research assistant at [CITMAga](https://citmaga.gal/en/home) in statistical classification.
 - :computer: During the summer of 2023, I worked at [Gradiant](https://github.com/Gradiant) as an intern on NLP tasks.
 - :rocket: I received a scholarship to collaborate research in NLP during the summer of 2022 at [CiTIUS](https://citius.gal).

### Projects :film_projector:
 - :turtle: As a continuation of my work at CITMAga, I collaborated to develop multiclass functionality for the open-source project [caretEnsemble](https://github.com/zachmayer/caretEnsemble).
 - :globe_with_meridians: I designed and developed a professional website for a nutritionist. You can check it out [here](https://alvaroleonnutricion.com).

### Interests & Skills :mag_right:

 - :speech_balloon: I'm experienced in Java, C, Python, R and C++.
 - :baby: I'm also learning Julia.
 - :dart: My main interests are NLP, Computer Vision, Statistical Classification & Remote Sensing.
 - :zap: I enjoy participating in programming competitions and taking on new challenges.
 - :family: I'm looking to collaborate on Open Source projects.
 - :video_game: I've taken part in several university-level programming contests and hackathons. If you're curious, you can see more on my [website](https://antongomez.github.io/portfolio/projects).
