#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a final year Mathematics and Computer Engineering student. During the summer of 2022, I was researching in the field of NLP with a scolarship at [CiTIUS](https://citius.gal/).

Currently, I'm working on my final thesis in Mathematics, where I'm studying statistical classifier ensembles with the aim of developing a system to evaluate them. Additionally, I'm exploring the idea of using classifiers to enlarge the features of a population. The objective is to increase knowledge about populations and to be able to apply another statistical classifier on the enlarged population.

### Trajectory
 - :books: I'm studying Maths and Computer Engineering at [USC](https://www.usc.gal/es/estudios/grados/ingenieria-arquitectura/doble-grado-ingenieria-informatica-matematicas).
 - :trophy: Our team, CostaCompas, won one of the prizes of [HackUDC](https://hackudc.gpul.org/). ([Link](https://devpost.com/software/costacompas?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=in_progress) to Devpost and [link](https://github.com/CastilloDel/costaCompas) to the project on GitHub).
 - :rocket: I received a scholarship to reasearch in NLP in 2022.

### Interests & Skills

 - :speech_balloon: I'm experienced in Java, C, and Python
 - :baby: I'm also learning C++.
 - :dart: My main interests are NLP, Clustering & Multivariate Analysis
 - :zap: I enjoy participating in programming competitions and taking on new challenges
 - :family: I'm looking to collaborate on Open Source projects.
